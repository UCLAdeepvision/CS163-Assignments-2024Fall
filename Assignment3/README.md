Welcome to our second assignment!

### Access
You can open the assignment in Colab by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vYI2YDMENCpVKQCl7FX6Dew4tUEOxrsh?usp=sharing), or you can use the downloaded version of the notebook [(23W_CS188_Assignment3.ipynb)](./24F_CS163_Assignment3.ipynb).

### Goals
The goals of this assignment are to:

1. Build a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch.
2. Build a Semantic Segmentation model using a ViT encoder.
 

By the end of this assignment, you will have gained experience with:

- Working with PyTorch and the MiniPlaces dataset for image classification.
- Implementing and training different types of neural networks using PyTorch.
- Debugging and troubleshooting issues that may arise during the development process.
- 
Please note that it may take some time to run the entire notebook and prepare the submission version. Make sure to allocate enough time for this task and start early. If you have any questions or run into any issues, please feel free to raise them in the Piazza forum or search the internet for debugging purposes. However, please do not directly copy code from other sources.
This assignment is due on ***Sunday, Nov 24th***.

**Do not use any Code AI to finish the assignment.**

‚ùó**Once you have finished all the questions, it will still take approximately *40 minutes* to re-run the entire notebook in order to prepare the submission version. Make sure to allocate enough time for this task and start early.**
