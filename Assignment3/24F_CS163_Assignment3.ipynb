        "Vision Transformer (ViT) is a state-of-the-art neural network architecture for image classification tasks. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been the standard in computer vision for many years, ViT relies on a self-attention mechanism to extract features from images. This approach has shown to achieve competitive results on various benchmark datasets, while also offering the flexibility to handle tasks that require attention over long-range dependencies in images. ViT has quickly gained popularity in the computer vision community, and has spurred further research into the use of self-attention mechanisms in other areas of deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will implement the ViT model on the Miniplaces dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "To implement ViT model for image classification, you will need to follow these steps：\n",
        "1.  Extract feature vectors from the input images using a trainable linear projection layer, which converts the 2D image patches into 1D feature vectors.\n",
        "2. Positional encoding: Add a learnable positional encoding to each feature vector, which provides spatial information to the model.\n",
        "3. Transformer encoder: Stack multiple Transformer encoder layers to process the encoded features, which allows the model to learn both local and global interactions between the image patches.\n",
        "4. Classification head: Add a classification head on top of the final encoded feature vector, which maps the learned representations to the corresponding class labels.\n",
        "5. Training and evaluation: Train the ViT model using an appropriate optimization algorithm and loss function, and evaluate its performance on the validation and testing sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are not familiair with ViT model, then you can read our textbook [Transformers for Vision](https://d2l.ai/chapter_attention-mechanisms-and-transformers/vision-transformer.html#fig-vit), or review our [discussion slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RKSnE9MOAGBu9T-_2TaBEm4ASF189Fms/view)."

Note that we do not need the CLS token anymore, since it is used primarily image-level statistics (i.e. class of the image). For semantic segmentation, we instead require a prediction for each individual pixel of the image.\n",

We will reshape the patches into a 2D image of height `H' = H / patch_size` and width `W' = W / patch_size`. The resulting output shape will be `(B x H' x W' x dim)`.\n",
        "3.  To be able to perform convolution operations, we will permute the resulting tensor to become `(B x dim x H' x W')`.\n",

        "5.  Remember `H'` and `W'` are of dimension `(H / patch_size)` and `(W / patch_size)` respectively. Since we want an output segmentation map with the same shape as the original image, we will upsample the map to have shape `(B x num_classes x H x W)`, corresponding to the predicted segmentation map.\n"
