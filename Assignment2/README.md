# Assignment 2

Welcome to our second assignment!

### Access
You can open the assignment by downloading the notebook [(24F_CS163_Assignment2.ipynb)](./24F_CS163_Assignment2.ipynb) locally and upload it to Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Goals
The goals of this assignment are to:

1. Build and train a convolutional neural network from scratch and using built-in PyTorch modules.
2. Build ResNet-18 from scarch and Finetune it different strategies.
3. Visualize the attention of ResNet using Class Activation Mapping
4. Come up with your own model and compete on a test leaderboard for extra credit.

By the end of this assignment, you will have gained experience with:

- Implementing and training cnns using PyTorch.
- Designing you own neural networks with the tips and tricks
- Debugging and troubleshooting issues that may arise during the development process.

Please note that it may take some time to run the entire notebook and prepare the submission version. Make sure to allocate enough time for this task and start early. If you have any questions or run into any issues, please feel free to raise them in the Piazza forum or search the internet for debugging purposes. However, please do not directly copy code from other sources.

This assignment is due on **Sunday, Nov 3**.

**Do not use any Code AI to finish the assignment.**

‚ùó**Once you have finished all the questions, it will still take approximately *60 minutes* to re-run the entire notebook in order to prepare the submission version. Make sure to allocate enough time for this task and start early.**

### Submission
Submit the completed notebook to BruinLearn. Make sure you have completed all the code implementations with all the results printed(marked as **Your Implementations **), and answered all the blanks at the end of each question.

Good luck and happy coding! Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and learn something new.
