# CS163-Assignments-2024Fall

This is the official repository for the assignments in the CS163 Computer Vision course at UCLA for the Fall 2024 term.

This course is designed to give you a broad introduction to computer vision with hands-on experience covering the basic concepts and techniques of deep learning. We will walk you through the course with four coding assignments. These assignments are designed for preparing you for advanced computer vision topics in the future, and you shall finish them independently. Most of the assignments will be completed using Google Colab, a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud and does not require any setup. 

If you have any questions or concerns about the code or documents in this repository, please feel free to ask in Piazza and we will respond as soon as possible. We welcome any suggestions or contributions to improve this course.

We appreciate you for suggestion and contribution to improve this course!
