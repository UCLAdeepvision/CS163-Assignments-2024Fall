# Assignment 4

Welcome to our fourth assignment!

### Access
You can open the assignment by downloading the notebook [(24F_CS163_Assignment4.ipynb)](./24F_CS163_Assignment4.ipynb) locally and upload it to Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Goals
In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to explore two applications of deep learning for computer vision:

1. Diffusion Models
2. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)

Through this assignment, you will first gain experience in building a diffusion model from scratch and understanding the state-of-the-art StableDiffusion text-to-image diffusion model. Additionally, you will delve into the concept of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and use them to represent a single large image with a neural network. Finally, you will explore advanced topics related to neural radiance fields.

As always, please feel free to post any questions or issues you encounter on the Piazza forum. And remember, please do not directly copy code from other sources.

This assignment is due on ***Sunday, Dec 8th***.

**Do not use any Code AI to finish the assignment.**

‚ùó**Once you have finished all the questions, it will still take approximately *60 minutes* to re-run the entire notebook in order to prepare the submission version. Make sure to allocate enough time for this task and start early.**

### Submission
Submit the completed notebook to BruinLearn. Make sure you have completed all the code implementations with all the results printed(marked as **Your Implementations **), and answered all the blanks at the end of each question.

Good luck and happy coding! Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and learn something new.
