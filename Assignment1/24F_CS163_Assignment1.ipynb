The MiniPlaces dataset is a subset of the [Places2 dataset](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/) and contains 100,000 images for training, 10,000 images for validation, and 10,000 images for testing, each of which has been annotated with one of 100 different scene categories.

This space is temporary in the sense that it is wiped clean whenever you close the notebook or disconnect from the VM. However, it is much faster than Google Drive storage, since it is located on the same machine as the VM. This makes it ideal for storing and accessing large datasets or intermediate data that is being used frequently in your notebook.\n",
